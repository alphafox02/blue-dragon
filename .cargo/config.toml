# Override zmq-sys vendored build to use system libzmq (required for CurveZMQ).
#
# The vendored zeromq-src compiles libzmq without libsodium, so CURVE
# encryption is unavailable.  System libzmq (libzmq3-dev / libzmq-devel)
# links against libsodium and has full CURVE support.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   Debian/Ubuntu/DragonOS:  sudo apt install libzmq3-dev
#   Fedora/RHEL:             sudo dnf install zeromq-devel
#   Arch:                    sudo pacman -S zeromq
#   macOS:                   brew install zeromq
#
# If your target triple is not listed below, add a section for it:
#   [target.YOUR-TRIPLE.zmq]
#   rustc-link-lib = ["zmq"]
# Run `rustc --print cfg | grep target` to find your triple.

[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.zmq]
rustc-link-lib = ["zmq"]

[target.aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu.zmq]
rustc-link-lib = ["zmq"]
